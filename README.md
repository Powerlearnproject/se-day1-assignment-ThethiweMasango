# SE_Day1


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall:
WLiner approach for predictable projects
suitable for : fixed requirments, timelines, and budgets Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Ans: it is the application of engineering techniques and principles to design,test,build and maintain software systems. it is important to the tech imdustry because it ensures software quality and realability, inshort it is essential for crating high quality software products that drive the tech innovation 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
recognized as a distinct engineering discipline 
2. Waterfall Model (1970) 
Introduced a structured,phase-by-phase development approach
3. Agile Manifesto(2001)
Emphasized flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery, revolutionazing software development

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Define project scope,goals and delivarables
Analysis: Gather and document requirements 
Software Architecture: Design and overall system structure
Coding: Develop the software application 
Quality Assurance: Test and validate the software 
Launch: Deploy the software application to end-users 
Support and updates: Maintain and improve the software overtime
Agile 
Flexible approach for adaptive projects 
suitable for: uncertin requiments, rapid and innovation and feedback

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software DEveloper : Designs, codes, tests and maintains softwares 
QA Engineer: Tests software to identify bugs and ensure quality
Project Manager: Defines product vision, roadmap and requirements.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments 
-streamline development with code editing, debuggging and testing tools
-Examples : Eclipse, Vs code, IntelliJ IDEA

Version Control Systems
-Track changes , collaborate, and manage code versions 
-Examples ; gIT, svn, Mercurial

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challanges :
-Technical debt
-Time Pressure
-Communication barriers
-Complexity
-Debbuging
Strategies:
-Prioritize refactoring 
-break tasks into smaller chunchks 
- Use clear documentation and collaboration tools
- Devide complex tasks into managable parts
- Use debbuging tools and logging


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Types of testing 
- software testsing : Verfies individual code components
- Intergration Testing: Tests how components interact
- System testing : Evaluates entire software system
- Acceptance testsing: Confirms software meets user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the process of designing and optomizing text prompts to interac effectively with AI models, ensuring accurate and revelant responses.
Importance :
Improves AI model accuracy and realibitity
enhances user experience and engagaementt
Unlocks AI models and capabilities and potential

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Original prompt : Write a story about a person who does something interesting

Improved prompt : Write a 2 - paragraph story about a 30 year old astronout who discovers a new planet

why its more effective :
Clear; Specifies the protagonists age and proffesion
Specific: Defines the plot and setting
Concise:Foceses on a single, achievable task
